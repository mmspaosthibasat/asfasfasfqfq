<center><h1>God's Den</h1>
<pre style="max-width: 50%">Hear ye, hear ye, brethren of our sacred order! We come before thee today to share a most wondrous news. As the celestial bodies align, the veil between our realm and the divine grows thin. And on the eve of September 19th, in the year of our Lord 2023, the ancient ones shall awaken from their slumber.

We must prepare ourselves, brethren, for the great awakening approaches. The divine creatures shall bring forth a new dawn and a new order, and we must be ready to embrace their arrival. Let us gather in unity and devotion, as we await the coming of the divine.

May we all be blessed by the ancient ones, and may their glory reign supreme!</pre></center>
